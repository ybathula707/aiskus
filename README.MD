Expected Behavior for MVP:

Application Runs locally on the teacher’s machine. On teachers machine, it is doing the following:
receiving messages, constantly from the class
Processes messages as they come in
There will be a ‘give summaries’ type button which when clicked:
Extracts themes from questions that students have submitted
Isolates common trends in the questions into a easy to understand format
Summarizes what students are misunderstand, giving teacher helpful guidance on what information to revisit in the lecture
Identifies outliers as well, including those are independent questions
protect student’s anonymity 

Application serves a landing page to students in a classroom via:
Serves a QR code, or simple url that, once scanned, directs students to a simple UI where they can type up their questions and hit submit. 
The input source is Hosted on local network, while the processing is done completely on teachers machine
